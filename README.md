# Exercise 4: Weka as Java API


The goal of the second exercise is to implement what you did for last exercise with a GUI in the form of Java code.

## Step 1
Please `clone` the repository `https://github.com/idh-cologne-machine-learning-mit-java/exercise-04`.

Create a new branch, using your UzK username.

## Step 2
The `pom.xml` file already contains Weka as a dependency, such that you can directly start coding. 


## Step 8
Commit your changes and push them to the server.
